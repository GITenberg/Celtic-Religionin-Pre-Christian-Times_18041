<p>It is only as prehistoric arch&aelig;ology has come to throw more
and more light on the early civilisations of Celtic lands that it has
become possible to interpret Celtic religion from a thoroughly modern
viewpoint.&nbsp; The author cordially acknowledges his indebtedness
to numerous writers on this subject, but his researches into some portions
of the field especially have suggested to him the possibility of giving
a new presentation to certain facts and groups of facts, which the existing
evidence disclosed.&nbsp; It is to be hoped that a new interest in the
religion of the Celts may thereby be aroused.</p>

I&mdash;INTRODUCTORY: THE CELTS</h2>
<p>In dealing with the subject of &lsquo;Celtic Religion&rsquo; the
first duty of the writer is to explain the sense in which the term &lsquo;Celtic&rsquo;
will be used in this work.&nbsp; It will be used in reference to those
countries and districts which, in historic times, have been at one time
or other mainly of Celtic speech.&nbsp; It does not follow that all
the races which spoke a form of the Celtic tongue, a tongue of the Indo-European
family, were all of the same stock.&nbsp; Indeed, ethnological and arch&aelig;ological
evidence tends to establish clearly that, in Gaul and Britain, for example,
man had lived for ages before the introduction of any variety of Aryan
or Indo-European speech, and this was probably the case throughout the
whole of Western and Southern Europe.&nbsp; Further, in the <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>light
of comparative philology, it has now become abundantly clear that the
forms of Indo-European speech which we call Celtic are most closely
related to those of the Italic family, of which family Latin is the
best known representative.&nbsp; From this it follows that we are to
look for the centre of dissemination of Aryan Celtic speech in some
district of Europe that could have been the natural centre of dissemination
also for the Italic languages.&nbsp; From this common centre, through
conquest and the commercial intercourse which followed it, the tribes
which spoke the various forms of Celtic and Italic speech spread into
the districts occupied by them in historic times.&nbsp; The common centre
of radiation for Celtic and Italic speech was probably in the districts
of Noricum and Pannonia, the modern Carniola, Carinthia, etc., and the
neighbouring parts of the Danube valley.&nbsp; The conquering Aryan-speaking
Celts and Italians formed a military aristocracy, and their success
in extending the range of their languages was largely due to their skill
in arms, combined, in all probability, with a talent for administration.&nbsp;
This military aristocracy was of kindred type to that which carried
Aryan speech into India and Persia, Armenia and Greece, not to speak
of the original speakers of the Teutonic <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>and
Slavonic tongues.&nbsp; In view of the necessity of discovering a centre,
whence the Indo-European or Aryan languages in general could have radiated
Eastwards, as well as Westwards, the tendency to-day is to regard these
tongues as having been spoken originally in some district between the
Carpathians and the Steppes, in the form of kindred dialects of a common
speech.&nbsp; Some branches of the tribes which spoke these dialects
penetrated into Central Europe, doubtless along the Danube, and, from
the Danube valley, extended their conquests together with their various
forms of Aryan speech into Southern and Western Europe.&nbsp; The proportion
of conquerors to conquered was not uniform in all the countries where
they held sway, so that the amount of Aryan blood in their resultant
population varied greatly.&nbsp; In most cases, the families of the
original conquerors, by their skill in the art of war and a certain
instinct of government, succeeded in making their own tongues the dominant
media of communication in the lands where they ruled, with the result
that most of the languages of Europe to-day are of the Aryan or Indo-European
type.&nbsp; It does not, however, follow necessarily from this that
the early religious ideas or the artistic civilisation of countries
now <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Aryan
in speech, came necessarily from the conquerors rather than the conquered.&nbsp;
In the last century it was long held that in countries of Aryan speech
the essential features of their civilisation, their religious ideas,
their social institutions, nay, more, their inhabitants themselves,
were of Aryan origin.</p>
<p>A more critical investigation has, however, enabled us to distinguish
clearly between the development of various factors of human life which
in their evolution can follow and often have followed more or less independent
lines.&nbsp; The physical history of race, for instance, forms a problem
by itself and must be studied by anthropological and ethnological methods.&nbsp;
Language, again, has often spread along lines other than those of race,
and its investigation appertains to the sphere of the philologist.&nbsp;
Material civilisation, too, has not of necessity followed the lines
either of racial or of linguistic development, and the search for its
ancient trade-routes may be safely left to the arch&aelig;ologist.&nbsp;
Similarly the spread of ideas in religion and thought is one which has
advanced on lines of its own, and its investigation must be conducted
by the methods and along the lines of the comparative study of religions.</p>
<p>In the wide sense, then, in which the word <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>&lsquo;Celtic
religion&rsquo; will be used in this work, it will cover the modes of
religious thought prevalent in the countries and districts, which, in
course of time, were mainly characterised by their Celtic speech.&nbsp;
To the sum-total of these religious ideas contributions have been made
from many sources.&nbsp; It would be rash to affirm that the various
streams of Aryan Celtic conquest made no contributions to the conceptions
of life and of the world which the countries of their conquest came
to hold (and the evidence of language points, indeed, to some such contributions),
but their quota appears to be small compared with that of their predecessors;
nor is this surprising, in view of the immense period during which the
lands of their conquest had been previously occupied.&nbsp; Nothing
is clearer than the marvellous persistence of traditional and immemorial
modes of thought, even in the face of conquest and subjugation, and,
whatever ideas on religion the Aryan conquerors of Celtic lands may
have brought with them, they whose conquests were often only partial
could not eradicate the inveterate beliefs of their predecessors, and
the result in the end was doubtless some compromise, or else the victory
of the earlier faith.</p>
<p>But the Aryan conquerors of Gaul and Italy <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>themselves
were not men who had advanced up the Danube in one generation.&nbsp;
Those men of Aryan speech who poured into the Italian peninsula and
into Gaul were doubtless in blood not unmixed with the older inhabitants
of Central Europe, and had entered into the body of ideas which formed
the religious beliefs of the men of the Danube valley.&nbsp; The common
modifications of the Aryan tongue, by Italians and Celts alike, as compared
with Greek, suggests contact with men of different speech.&nbsp; Among
the names of Celtic gods, too, like those of other countries, we find
roots that are apparently irreducible to any found in Indo-European
speech, and we know not what pre-Aryan tongues may have contributed
them.&nbsp; Scholars, to-day, are far more alive than they ever were
before to the complexity of the contributory elements that have entered
into the tissue of the ancient religions of mankind, and the more the
relics of Celtic religion are investigated, the more complex do its
contributory factors become.&nbsp; In the long ages before history there
were unrecorded conquests and migrations innumerable, and ideas do not
fail to spread because there is no historian to record them.</p>
<p>The more the scanty remnants of Celtic religion <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>are
examined, the clearer it becomes that many of its characteristic features
had been evolved during the vast period of the ages of stone.&nbsp;
During these millennia, men had evolved, concomitantly with their material
civilisation, a kind of working philosophy of life, traces of which
are found in every land where this form of civilisation has prevailed.&nbsp;
Man&rsquo;s religion can never be dissociated from his social experience,
and the painful stages through which man reached the agricultural life,
for example, have left their indelible impress on the mind of man in
Western Europe, as they have in every land.&nbsp; We are thus compelled,
from the indications which we have of Celtic religion, in the names
of its deities, its rites, and its survivals in folk-lore and legend,
to come to the conclusion, that its fundamental groundwork is a body
of ideas, similar to those of other lands, which were the natural correlatives
of the phases of experience through which man passed in his emergence
into civilised life.&nbsp; To demonstrate and to illustrate these relations
will be the aim of the following chapters.</p>
<h2><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>CHAPTER
II&mdash;THE CHIEF PHASES OF CELTIC CIVILISATION</h2>
<p>In the chief countries of Celtic civilisation, Gaul, Cisalpine and
Transalpine, Britain and Ireland, abundant materials have been found
for elucidating the stages of culture through which man passed in prehistoric
times.&nbsp; In Britain, for example, pal&aelig;olithic man has left
numerous specimens of his implements, but the forms even of these rude
implements suggest that they, too, have been evolved from still more
primitive types.&nbsp; Some antiquarians have thought to detect such
earlier types in the stones that have been named &lsquo;eoliths&rsquo;
found in Kent, but, though these &lsquo;eoliths&rsquo; may possibly
show human use, the question of their history is far from being settled.&nbsp;
It is certain, however, that man succeeded in maintaining himself for
ages in the company of the mammoth, the cave-bear, and other animals
now extinct.&nbsp; Whether pal&aelig;olithic man survived the Ice Age
in Britain has not so far been satisfactorily <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>decided.&nbsp;
In Gaul, however, there is fair evidence of continuity between the Pal&aelig;olithic
and Neolithic periods, and this continuity must obviously have existed
somewhere.&nbsp; Still in spite of the indications of continuity, the
civilisation of primitive man in Gaul presents one aspect that is without
any analogues in the life of the pal&aelig;olithic men of the River
Drift period, or in that of man of the New Stone Age.&nbsp; The feature
in question is the remarkable artistic skill shown by the cave men of
the Dordogne district.&nbsp; Some of the drawings and carvings of these
men reveal a sense of form which would have done credit to men of a
far later age.&nbsp; A feature such as this, whatever may have been
its object, whether it arose from an effort by means of &lsquo;sympathetic
magic&rsquo; to catch animals, as M. Salomon Reinach suggests, or to
the mere artistic impulse, is a standing reminder to us of the scantiness
of our data for estimating the lines of man&rsquo;s religious and other
development in the vast epochs of prehistoric time.</p>
<p>We know that from the life of hunting man passed into the pastoral
stage, having learned to tame animals.&nbsp; How he came to do so, and
by what motives he was actuated, is still a mystery.&nbsp; It may be,
as M. Salomon Reinach has also <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>suggested,
that it was some curious and indefinable sense of kinship with them
that led him to do so, or more probably, as the present writer thinks,
some sense of a need of the alliance of animals against hostile spirits.&nbsp;
In all probability it was no motive which we can now fathom.&nbsp; The
mind of early man was like the unfathomable mind of a boy.&nbsp; From
the pastoral life again man passed after long ages into the life of
agriculture, and the remains of neolithic man in Gaul and in Britain
give us glimpses of his life as a farmer.&nbsp; The ox, the sheep, the
pig, the goat, and the dog were his domestic animals; he could grow
wheat and flax, and could supplement the produce of his farm by means
of hunting and fishing.&nbsp; Neolithic man could spin and weave; he
could obtain the necessary flint for his implements, which he made by
chipping and polishing, and he could also make pottery of a rude variety.&nbsp;
In its essentials we have here the beginnings of the agricultural civilisation
of man all the world over.&nbsp; In life, neolithic man dwelt sometimes
in pit-dwellings and sometimes in hut-circles, covered with a roof of
branches supported by a central pole.&nbsp; In death, he was buried
with his kin in long mounds of earth called barrows, in chambered cairns
and cromlechs or dolmens.&nbsp; <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>The
latter usually consist of three standing stones covered by a cap-stone;
forming the stony skeleton of a grave that has been exposed to view
after the mound of earth that covered it has been washed away.&nbsp;
In their graves the dead were buried in a crouching attitude, and fresh
burials were made as occasion required.&nbsp; Sometimes the cromlech
is double, and occasionally there is a hole in one of the stones, the
significance of which is unknown, unless it may have been for the ingress
and egress of souls.&nbsp; Graves of the dolmen or cromlech type are
found in all the countries of Western Europe, North Africa, and elsewhere,
wherever stone suitable for the purpose abounds, and in this we have
a striking illustration of the way in which lines of development in
man&rsquo;s material civilisation are sooner or later correlated to
his geographical, geological, and other surroundings.&nbsp; The religious
ideas of man in neolithic times also came into correlation with the
conditions of his development, and the uninterpreted stone circles and
pillars of the world are a standing witness to the religious zeal of
a mind that was haunted by stone.&nbsp; Before proceeding to exemplify
this thesis the subsequent trend of Celtic civilisation may be briefly
sketched.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Through
the pacific intercourse of commerce, bronze weapons and implements began
to find their way, about 2000 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> or earlier,
from Central and Southern Europe into Gaul, and thence into Britain.&nbsp;
In Britain the Bronze Age begins at about 1500 or 1400 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
and it is thought by some arch&aelig;ologists that bronze was worked
at this period by the aid of native tin in Britain itself.&nbsp; There
are indications, however, that the introduction of bronze into Britain
was not by way of commerce alone.&nbsp; About the beginning of the Bronze
period are found evidences in this island of a race of different type
from that of neolithic man, being characterised by a round skull and
a powerful build, and by general indications of a martial bearing.&nbsp;
The remains of this race are usually found in round barrows.</p>
<p>This race, which certainly used bronze weapons, is generally believed
to have been the first wave that reached Britain of Aryan conquerors
of Celtic speech from the nearest part of the continent, where it must
have arrived some time previously, probably along the Rhine valley.&nbsp;
As the type of Celtic speech that has penetrated farthest to the west
is that known as the Goidelic or Irish, it has not unreasonably been
thought that this must have been the type that arrived in Britain first.&nbsp;
<!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>There
are indications, too, that it was this type that penetrated furthest
into the west of Gaul.&nbsp; Its most marked characteristic is its preservation
of the pronunciation of U as &lsquo;oo&rsquo; and of QU, while the &lsquo;Brythonic&rsquo;
or Welsh variety changed U to a sound pronounced like the French &lsquo;u&rsquo;
or the German &lsquo;&uuml;&rsquo; and also QU to P.&nbsp; There is
a similar line of cleavage in the Italic languages, where Latin corresponds
to Goidelic, and Oscan and Umbrian to Brythonic.&nbsp; Transalpine Gaul
was probably invaded by Aryan-speaking Celts from more than one direction,
and the infiltration and invasion of new-comers, when it had once begun,
was doubtless continuous through these various channels.&nbsp; There
are cogent reasons for thinking that ultimately the dominant type of
Celtic speech over the greater part of Gaul came to be that of the P
rather than the QU type, owing to the influx from the East and Northeast
of an overflow from the Rhine valley of tribes speaking that dialect;
a dialect which, by force of conquest and culture, tended to spread
farther and farther West.&nbsp; Into Britain, too, as time went on,
the P type of Celtic was carried, and has survived in Welsh and Cornish,
the remnants of the tongue of ancient Britain.&nbsp; We know, too, from
the name Epor&#275;dia (Yvrea), that <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>this
dialect of Celtic must have spread into Cisalpine Gaul.&nbsp; The latter
district may have received its first Celtic invaders direct from the
Danube valley, as M. Alexandre Bertrand held, but it would be rash to
assume that all its invaders came from that direction.&nbsp; In connection,
however, with the history of Celtic religion it is not the spread of
the varying types of Celtic dialect that is important, but the changes
in the civilisation of Gaul and Britain, which reacted on religious
ideas or which introduced new factors into the religious development
of these lands.</p>
<p>The predatory expeditions and wars of conquest of military Celtic
tribes in search for new homes for their superfluous populations brought
into prominence the deities of war, as was the case also with the ancient
Romans, themselves an agricultural and at the same time a predatory
race.&nbsp; The prominence of war in Celtic tribal life at one stage
has left us the names of a large number of deities that were identified
with Mars and Bellona, though all the war-gods were not originally such.&nbsp;
In the Roman calendar there is abundant evidence that Mars was at one
time an agricultural god as well as a god of war.&nbsp; The same, as
will be shown later, was the probable history of some of the Celtic
deities, who were <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>identified
in Roman times with Mars and Bellona.&nbsp; C&aelig;sar tells us that
Mars had at one time been the chief god of the Gauls, and that in Germany
that was still the case.&nbsp; In Britain, also, we find that there
were several deities identified with Mars, notably Belatucadrus and
Cocidius, and this, too, points in the direction of a development of
religion under military influence.&nbsp; The Gauls appear to have made
great strides in military matters and in material civilisation during
the Iron Age.&nbsp; The culture of the Early Iron Age of Hallstatt had
been developed in Gaul on characteristic lines of its own, resulting
in the form now known as the La T&egrave;ne or Marnian type.&nbsp; This
type derives it name from the striking specimens of it that were discovered
at La T&egrave;ne on the shore of Lake Neuch&acirc;tel, and in the extensive
cemeteries of the Marne valley, the burials of which cover a period
of from 350-200 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&nbsp; It was during
the third century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> that this characteristic
culture of Gaul reached its zenith, and gave definite shape to the beautiful
curved designs known as those of Late-Celtic Art.&nbsp; Iron appears
to have been introduced into Britain about 300 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
and the designs of Late-Celtic Art are here represented best of all.&nbsp;
Excellent specimens of Late-Celtic culture have been found in Yorkshire
<!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>and
elsewhere, and important links with continental developments have been
discovered at Aylesford, Aesica, Limavady, and other places.&nbsp; Into
the development of this typical Gaulish culture elements are believed
to have entered by way of the important commercial avenue of the Rhone
valley from Massilia (Marseilles), from Greece (<i>vi&acirc;</i> Venetia),
and possibly from Etruria.&nbsp; Prehistoric arch&aelig;ology affords
abundant proofs that, in countries of Celtic speech, metal-working in
bronze, iron, and gold reached a remarkably high pitch of perfection,
and this is a clear indication that Celtic countries and districts which
were on the line of trade routes, like the Rhone valley, had attained
to a material civilisation of no mean character before the Roman conquest.&nbsp;
In Britain, too, the districts that were in touch with continental commerce
had, as C&aelig;sar tells us, also developed in the same direction.&nbsp;
The religious counterpart of this development in civilisation is the
growth in many parts of Gaul, as attested by C&aelig;sar and by many
inscriptions and place-names, of the worship of gods identified with
Mercury and Minerva, the deities of civilisation and commerce.&nbsp;
It is no accident that one of the districts most conspicuous for this
worship was the territory of the Allobrogic confederation, <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>where
the commerce of the Rhone valley found its most remarkable development.&nbsp;
From this sketch of Celtic civilisation it will readily be seen how
here as elsewhere the religious development of the Celts stood closely
related to the development of their civilisation generally.&nbsp; It
must be borne in mind, however, that all parts of the Celtic world were
not equally affected by the material development in question.&nbsp;
Part of the complexity of the history of Celtic religion arises from
the fact that we cannot be always certain of the degree of progress
in civilisation which any given district had made, of the ideas which
pervaded it, or of the absorbing interests of its life.&nbsp; Another
difficulty, too, is that the accounts of Celtic religion given by ancient
authorities do not always harmonise with the indisputable evidence of
inscriptions.&nbsp; The probability is that the religious practices
of the Celtic world were no more homogeneous than its general civilisation,
and that the ancient authorities are substantially true in their statements
about certain districts, certain periods, or certain sections of society,
while the inscriptions, springing as they do from the influence of the
Gallo-Roman civilisation, especially of Eastern Gaul and military Britain,
give us most valuable supplementary <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>evidence
for districts and environments of a different kind.&nbsp; The inscriptions,
especially by the names of deities which they reveal, have afforded
most valuable clues to the history of Celtic religion, even in stages
of civilisation earlier than those to which they themselves belong.&nbsp;
In the next chapter the correlation of Celtic religious ideas to the
stages of Celtic civilisation will be further developed.</p>

III&mdash;THE CORRELATION OF CELTIC RELIGION WITH THE GROWTH OF CELTIC
CIVILISATION</h2>
<p>In dealing with the long vista of prehistoric time, it is very difficult
for us, in our effort after perspective, not to shorten unduly in our
thoughts the vast epochs of its duration.&nbsp; We tend, too, to forget,
that in these unnumbered millennia there was ample time for it to be
possible over certain areas of Europe to evolve what were practically
new races, through the prepotency of particular stocks and the annihilation
of others.&nbsp; During these epochs, again, after speech had arisen,
there was time enough to recast completely many a language, for before
the dawn of history language was no more free from change than it is
now, and in these immense epochs whatever ideas as to the world of their
surroundings were vaguely felt by prehistoric men and formulated for
them by their kinsmen of genius, had abundant time in which to die or
to win supremacy.&nbsp; There must have been &aelig;ons before the dawn
even of conscious <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>animism,
and the experiment of trying sympathetic magic was, when first attempted,
probably regarded as a master-stroke of genius.&nbsp; The Stone Age
itself was a long era of great if slow progress in civilisation, and
the evolution of the practices and ideas which emerge as the concomitants
of its agricultural stage, when closely regarded, bear testimony to
the mind&rsquo;s capacity for religious progress in the light of experience
and intelligent experiment, and at the same time to the errors into
which it fell.&nbsp; The Stone Age has left its sediment in all the
folk-lore of the world.&nbsp; To the casual observer many of the ideas
embedded in it may seem a mass of error, and so they are when judged
unhistorically, but when viewed critically, and at the same time historically,
they afford many glimpses of prehistoric genius in a world where life
was of necessity a great experiment.&nbsp; The folk-lore of the world
reveals for the same stages of civilisation a wonderful uniformity and
homogeneity, as Dr. J. G. Frazer has abundantly shown in his <i>Golden
Bough</i>.&nbsp; This uniformity is not, however, due to necessary uniformity
of origin, but to a great extent to the fact that it represents the
state of equilibrium arrived at between minds at a certain level and
their environment, along lines of thought directed <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>by
the momentum given by the traditions of millennia, and the survival
in history of the men who carefully regarded them.&nbsp; The apparently
unreasoned prohibitions often known as &lsquo;taboos,&rsquo; many of
which still persist even in modern civilised life, have their roots
in ideas and experiences which no speculation of ours can now completely
fathom, however much we may guess at their origin.&nbsp; Many of these
ancient prohibitions have vanished under new conditions, others have
often survived from a real or supposed harmony with new experiences,
that have arisen in the course of man&rsquo;s history.&nbsp; After passing
through a stage when he was too preoccupied with his material cares
and wants to consider whether he was haunted or not, early man in the
Celtic world as elsewhere, after long epochs of vague unrest, came to
realise that he was somehow haunted in the daytime as well as at night,
and it was this sense of being haunted that impelled his intellect and
his imagination to seek some explanation of his feelings.&nbsp; Primitive
man came to seek a solution not of the Universe as a whole (for of this
he had no conception), but of the local Universe, in which he played
a part.&nbsp; In dealing with Celtic folk-lore, it is very remarkable
how it mirrors the characteristic local colouring and scenery of the
districts <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>in
which it has originated.&nbsp; In a country like Wales, for example,
it is the folk-lore of springs, caves, mountains, lakes, islands, and
the forms of its imagination, here as elsewhere, reflect unmistakably
the land of its origin.&nbsp; Where it depicts an &lsquo;other world,&rsquo;
that &lsquo;other world&rsquo; is either on an island or it is a land
beneath the sea, a lake, or a river, or it is approachable only through
some cave or opening in the earth.&nbsp; In the hunting-grounds of the
Celtic world the primitive hunter knew every cranny of the greater part
of his environment with the accuracy born of long familiarity, but there
were some peaks which he could not scale, some caves which he could
not penetrate, some jungles into which he could not enter, and in these
he knew not what monsters might lurk or unknown beings might live.&nbsp;
In Celtic folk-lore the belief in fabulous monsters has not yet ceased.&nbsp;
Man was surrounded by dangers visible and invisible, and the time came
when some prehistoric man of genius propounded the view that all the
objects around him were no less living than himself.&nbsp; This animistic
view of the world, once adopted, made great headway from the various
centres where it originated, and man derived from it a new sense of
kinship with his world, but also new terrors from it.&nbsp; Knowing
<!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>from
the experience of dreams that he himself seemed able to wander away
from himself, he thought in course of time that other living things
were somehow double, and the world around him came to be occupied, not
merely with things that were alive, but with other selves of these things,
that could remain in them or leave them at will.&nbsp; Here, again,
this new prehistoric philosophy gave an added interest to life, but
it was none the less a source of fresh terrors.&nbsp; The world swarmed
with invisible spirits, some friendly, some hostile, and, in view of
these beings, life had to be regulated by strict rules of actions and
prohibitions.&nbsp; Even in the neolithic stage the inhabitants of Celtic
countries had attained to the religious ideas in question, as is seen
not only by their folk-lore and by the names of groups of goddesses
such as the Matres (or mothers), but by the fact that in historic times
they had advanced well beyond this stage to that of named and individualised
gods.&nbsp; As in all countries where the gods were individualised,
the men of Celtic lands, whether aborigines or invaders, had toiled
along the steep ascent from the primitive vague sense of being haunted
to a belief in gods who, like Esus, Teutates, Grannos, Bormanus, Litavis,
had names of a definite character.</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Among
the prohibitions which had established themselves among the races of
Celtic lands, as elsewhere, was that directed against the shedding of
the blood of one&rsquo;s own kin.&nbsp; There are indications, too,
that some at any rate of the tribes inhabiting these countries reckoned
kinship through the mother, as in fact continued to be the case among
the Picts of Scotland into historic times.&nbsp; It does not follow,
as we know from other countries, that the pre-Aryan tribes of Gaul and
Britain, or indeed the Aryan tribes themselves in their earliest stage,
regarded their original ancestors as human.&nbsp; Certain names of deities
such as Tarvos (the bull), Moccos (the pig), Ep&#335;na (the goddess
of horses), Dam&#335;na (the goddess of cattle), Mullo (the ass), as
well as the fact that the ancient Britons, according to C&aelig;sar,
preserved the hen, the goose, and the hare, but did not kill and eat
them, all point to the fact that in these countries as elsewhere certain
animals were held in supreme respect and were carefully guarded from
harm.&nbsp; Judging from the analogy of kindred phenomena in other countries,
the practice of respecting certain animals was often associated with
the belief that all the members of certain clans were descended from
one or other of them, but how far this system was elaborated in the
<!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Celtic
world it is hard to say.&nbsp; This phenomenon, which is widely known
as totemism, appears to be suggested by the prominence given to the
wild boar on Celtic coins and ensigns, and by the place assigned on
some inscriptions and bas-reliefs to the figure of a horned snake as
well as by the effigies of other animals that have been discovered.&nbsp;
It is not easy to explain the beginnings of totemism in Gaul or elsewhere,
but it should always be borne in mind that early man could not regard
it as an axiomatic truth that he was the superior of every other animal.&nbsp;
To reach that proud consciousness is a very high step in the development
of the human perspective, and it is to the credit of the Celts that,
when we know them in historic times, they appear to have attained to
this height, inasmuch as the human form is given to their deities.&nbsp;
It is not always remembered how great a step in religious evolution
is implied when the gods are clothed with human attributes.&nbsp; M.
Salomon Reinach, in his account of the vestiges of totemism among the
Celts, suggests that totemism was merely the hypertrophy of early man&rsquo;s
social sense, which extended from man to the animals around him.&nbsp;
This may possibly be the case, but it is not improbable that man also
thought to discover in <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>certain
animals much-needed allies against some of the visible and invisible
enemies that beset him.&nbsp; In his conflict with the malign powers
around him, he might well have regarded certain animals as being in
some respects stronger combatants against those powers than himself;
and where they were not physically stronger, some of them, like the
snake, had a cunning and a subtlety that seemed far to surpass his own.&nbsp;
In course of time certain bodies of men came to regard themselves as
being in special alliance with some one animal, and as being descended
from that animal as their common ancestor.&nbsp; The existence side
by side of various tribes, each with its definite totem, has not yet
been fully proved for the Gaulish system, and may well have been a developed
social arrangement that was not an essential part of such a mode of
thought in its primary forms.&nbsp; The place of animal-worship in the
Celtic religion will be more fully considered in a later chapter.&nbsp;
Here it is only indicated as a necessary stage in relation to man&rsquo;s
civilisation in the hunting and the pastoral stages, which had to be
passed through before the historic deities of Gaul and Britain in Roman
times could have come into being.&nbsp; Certain of the divine names
of the historic period, like Artio (the bear-goddess), Moccus (the <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>pig),
Ep&#335;na (the mare), and Dam&#335;na (the sheep), bear the unmistakable
impress of having been at one time those of animals.</p>
<p>As for the stage of civilisation at which totemism originated, there
is much difference of opinion.&nbsp; The stage of mind which it implies
would suggest that it reflects a time when man&rsquo;s mind was preoccupied
with wild beasts, and when the alliances and friendships, which he would
value in life, might be found in that sphere.&nbsp; There is much plausibility
in the view put forward by M. Salomon Reinach, that the domestication
of animals itself implies a totemistic habit of thought, and the consequent
protection of these animals by means of taboos from harm and death.&nbsp;
It may well be that, after all, the usefulness of domestic animals from
a material point of view was only a secondary consideration for man,
and a happy discovery after unsuccessful totemistic attentions to other
animals.&nbsp; We know not how many creatures early man tried to associate
with himself but failed.</p>
<p>In all stages of man&rsquo;s history the alternation of the seasons
must have brought some rudiments of order and system into his thoughts,
though for a long time he was too preoccupied to reflect upon the regularly
recurring vicissitudes of his life.&nbsp; In the pastoral stage, the
sense of order came to <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>be
more marked than in that of hunting, and quickened the mind to fresh
thought.&nbsp; The earth came to be regarded as the Mother from whom
all things came, and there are abundant indications that the earth as
the Mother, the Queen, the Long-lived one, etc., found her natural place
as a goddess among the Celts.&nbsp; Her names and titles were probably
not in all places or in all tribes the same.&nbsp; But it is in the
agricultural stage that she entered in Celtic lands, as she did in other
countries, into her completest religious heritage, and this aspect of
Celtic religion will be dealt with more fully in connection with the
spirits of vegetation.&nbsp; This phase of religion in Celtic countries
is one which appears to underlie some of its most characteristic forms,
and the one which has survived longest in Celtic folk-lore.&nbsp; The
Earth-mother with her progeny of spirits, of springs, rivers, mountains,
forests, trees, and corn, appears to have supplied most of the grouped
and individualised gods of the Celtic pantheon.&nbsp; The Dis, of whom
C&aelig;sar speaks as the ancient god of the Gauls, was probably regarded
as her son, to whom the dead returned in death.&nbsp; Whether he is
the Gaulish god depicted with a hammer, or as a huge dog swallowing
the dead, has not yet been established with any degree of certainty.</p>
<h2><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>CHAPTER
IV&mdash;CELTIC RELIGION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF INDIVIDUALISED DEITIES</h2>
<p>Like other religions, those of the Celtic lands of Europe supplemented
the earlier animism by a belief in spirits, who belonged to trees, animals,
rocks, mountains, springs, rivers, and other natural phenomena, and
in folk-lore there still survives abundant evidence that the Celt regarded
spirits as taking upon themselves a variety of forms, animal and human.&nbsp;
It was this idea of spirits in animal form that helped to preserve the
memory of the older totemism into historic times.&nbsp; It is thus that
we have names of the type of Brannog&#277;nos (son of the raven), Artog&#277;nos
(son of the bear), and the like, not to speak of simpler names like
Bran (raven), March (horse), surviving into historic times.&nbsp; Bronze
images, too, have been found at Neuvy-en-Sullias, of a horse and a stag
(now in the Orleans museum), provided with rings, which were, as M.
Salomon Reinach suggests, <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>probably
used for the purpose of carrying these images in procession.&nbsp; The
wild boar, too, was a favourite emblem of Gaul, and there is extant
a bronze figure of a Celtic Diana riding on a boar&rsquo;s back.&nbsp;
At Bolar, near Nuits, there was discovered a bronze mule.&nbsp; In the
museum at Mayence is a bas-relief of the goddess of horses, Ep&#335;na
(from the Gaulish <i>Epos</i>=Lat. <i>equus</i>, horse), riding on horseback.&nbsp;
One of the most important monuments of this kind is a figure of Artio,
the bear-goddess (from Celtic <i>Artos</i>, a bear), found at Muri near
Berne.&nbsp; In front of her stood a figure of a bear, which was also
found with her.&nbsp; The bull of the Tarvos Trigaranos bas-relief of
Notre Dame was also in all likelihood originally a totem, and similarly
the horned serpents of other bas-reliefs, as well as the boar found
on Gaulish ensigns and coins, especially in Belgic territory.&nbsp;
There is a representation, too, of a raven on a bas-relief at Compi&egrave;gne.&nbsp;
The name &lsquo;Moccus,&rsquo; which is identified with Mercury, on
inscriptions, and which is found inscribed at Langres, Trobaso, the
valley of the Ossola and the Borgo san Dalmazzo, is undoubtedly the
philological equivalent of the Welsh <i>moch</i> (swine).&nbsp; In Britain,
too, the boar is frequently found on the coins of the Iceni and other
tribes.&nbsp; In Italy, according to <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>Mr.
Warde Fowler, the pig was an appropriate offering to deities of the
earth, so that in the widespread use of the pig as a symbol in the Celtic
world, there may be some ancient echo of a connection between it and
the earth-spirit.&nbsp; Its diet of acorns, too, may have marked it
out, in the early days of life in forest-clearings, as the animal embodiment
of the oak-spirit.&nbsp; In the legends of the Celtic races, even in
historic times, the pig, and especially the boar, finds an honoured
place.&nbsp; In addition to the animals aforementioned, the ass, too,
was probably at one time venerated in one of the districts of Gaul,
and it is not improbable that Mullo, the name of a god identified with
Mars and regarded as the patron of muleteers, mentioned on inscriptions
(at Nantes, Craon, and Les Provench&egrave;res near Craon), meant originally
&lsquo;an ass.&rsquo;&nbsp; The goddess Ep&#335;na, also, whose worship
was widely spread, was probably at one time an animal goddess in the
form of a mare, and the name of another goddess, Dam&#335;na, either
from the root <i>dam</i>=Ir. <i>dam</i>, (ox); or Welsh <i>daf-ad</i>
(sheep), may similarly be that of an ancient totem sheep or cow.&nbsp;
Nor was it in the animal world alone that the Celts saw indications
of the divine.&nbsp; While the chase and the pastoral life concentrated
the mind&rsquo;s attention on the life of animals, the <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>growth
of agriculture fixed man&rsquo;s thoughts on the life of the earth,
and all that grew upon it, while at the same time he was led to think
more and more of the mysterious world beneath the earth, from which
all things came and to which all things returned.&nbsp; Nor could he
forget the trees of the forest, especially those which, like the oak,
had provided him with their fruit as food in time of need.&nbsp; The
name Druid, as well as that of the centre of worship of the Gauls of
Asia Minor, Drunemeton (the oak-grove), the statement of Maximus of
Tyre that the representation of Zeus to the Celts was a high oak, Pliny&rsquo;s
account of Druidism (<i>Nat. Hist</i>., xvi. 95), the numerous inscriptions
to Silvanus and Silvana, the mention of Derv&#335;nes or Dervonnae on
an inscription at Cavalzesio near Brescia, and the abundant evidence
of survivals in folk-lore as collected by Dr. J. G. Frazer and others,
all point to the fact that tree-worship, and especially that of the
oak, had contributed its full share to the development of Celtic religion,
at any rate in some districts and in some epochs.&nbsp; The development
of martial and commercial civilisation in later times tended to restrict
its typical and more primitive developments to the more conservative
parts of the Celtic world.&nbsp; The fact that in C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
time its main <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>centre
in Gaul was in the territory of the Carnutes, the tribe which has given
its name to Chartres, suggests that its chief votaries were mainly in
that part of the country.&nbsp; This, too, was the district of the god
Esus (the eponymous god of the Essuvii), and in some degree of Teutates,
the cruelty of whose rites is mentioned by Lucan.&nbsp; It had occurred
to the present writer, before finding the same view expressed by M.
Salomon Reinach, that the worship of Esus in Gaul was almost entirely
local in character.&nbsp; With regard to the rites of the Druids, C&aelig;sar
tells us that it was customary to make huge images of wickerwork, into
which human beings, usually criminals, were placed and burnt.&nbsp;
The use of wickerwork, and the suggestion that the rite was for purifying
the land, indicates a combination of the ideas of tree-worship with
those of early agricultural life.&nbsp; When the Emperor Claudius is
said by Suetonius to have suppressed Druidism, what is meant is, in
all probability, that the more inhuman rites were suppressed, leading,
as the Scholiasts on Lucan seem to suggest, to a substitution of animal
victims for men.&nbsp; On the side of civil administration and education,
the functions of the Druids, as the successors of the primitive medicine
men and magicians, doubtless varied greatly in different <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>parts
of Gaul and Britain according to the progress that had been made in
the differentiation of functions in social life.&nbsp; The more we investigate
the state of the Celtic world in ancient times, the clearer it becomes,
that in civilisation it was very far from being homogeneous, and this
heterogeneity of civilisation must have had its influence on religion
as well as on other social phenomena.&nbsp; The natural conservatism
of agricultural life, too, perpetuated many practices even into comparatively
late times, and of these we catch a glimpse in Gregory of Tours, when
he tells us that at Autun the goddess Berecyntia was worshipped, her
image being carried on a wagon for the protection of the fields and
the vines.&nbsp; It is not impossible that by Berecyntia Gregory means
the goddess Brigindu, whose name occurs on an inscription at Volnay
in the same district of Gaul.&nbsp; The belief in corn-spirits, and
other ideas connected with the central thought of the farmer&rsquo;s
life, show, by their persistence in Celtic as well as other folklore,
how deeply they had entered into the inner tissue of the agricultural
mind, so as to be linked to its keenest emotions.&nbsp; Here the rites
of religion, whether persuasive as in prayer, or compulsory as in sympathetic
magic, whether associated with communal or propitiatory sacrifice, whether
directed <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>to
the earth or to the heaven, all had an intensely practical and terribly
real character, due to man&rsquo;s constant preoccupation with the growth
and storage of food for man and beast.&nbsp; In the hunting, the pastoral,
and above all in the agricultural life, religion was not a matter merely
of imagination or sentiment, but one most intimately associated with
the daily practice of life, and this practical interest included in
its purview rivers, springs, forests, mountains, and all the setting
of man&rsquo;s existence.&nbsp; And what is true of agriculture is true
also, in a greater or less degree, of the life of the Celtic metal-worker
or the Celtic sailor.&nbsp; Even in late Welsh legend Amaethon (old
Celtic <i>Ambact&#335;nos</i>), the patron god of farming (Welsh <i>Amaeth</i>),
and Gofannon, the patron god of the metal-worker (Welsh <i>gof</i>,
Irish <i>gobha</i>), were not quite forgotten, and the prominence of
the worship of the counterparts of Mercury and Minerva in Gaul in historic
times was due to the sense of respect and gratitude, which each trade
and each locality felt for the deity who had rid the land of monsters,
and who had brought man into the comparative calm of civilised life.</p>
<h2><!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>CHAPTER
V&mdash;THE HUMANISED GODS OF CELTIC RELIGION</h2>
<p>One of the most striking facts connected with the Celtic religion
is the large number of names of deities which it includes.&nbsp; These
names are known to us almost entirely from inscriptions, for the most
part votive tablets, in acknowledgment of some benefit, usually that
of health, conferred by the god on man.&nbsp; In Britain these votive
tablets are chiefly found in the neighbourhood of the Roman walls and
camps, but we cannot be always certain that the deities mentioned are
indigenous.&nbsp; In Gaul, however, we are on surer ground in associating
certain deities with certain districts, inasmuch as the evidence of
place-names is often a guide.&nbsp; These inscriptions are very unevenly
distributed over Gaulish territory, the Western and the North-Western
districts being very sparsely represented.</p>
<p>In the present brief sketch it is impossible to enter into a full
discussion of the relations of the <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>names
found on inscriptions to particular localities, and the light thus thrown
on Celtic religion; but it may be here stated that investigation tends
to confirm the local character of most of the deities which the inscriptions
name.&nbsp; Out of these deities, some, it is true, in the process of
evolution, gained a wider field of worshippers, while others, like Lugus,
may even have been at one time more widely worshipped than they came
to be in later times.&nbsp; Occasionally a name like Lugus (Irish <i>Lug</i>),
Segomo (Irish, in the genitive, <i>Segamonas</i>), Cam&#365;los, whence
Camulod&#363;num (Colchester), Bel&#277;nos (Welsh <i>Belyn</i>), Map&#335;nos
(Welsh <i>Mabon</i>), Litavis (Welsh <i>Llydaw</i>), by its existence
in Britain as well as in Gaul, suggests that it was either one of the
ancient deities of the Aryan Celts, or one whose worship came to extend
over a larger area than its fellows.&nbsp; Apart from a few exceptional
considerations of this kind, however, the local character of the deities
is most marked.</p>
<p>A very considerable number are the deities of springs and rivers.&nbsp;
In Noricum, for example, we have Adsall&#363;ta, a goddess associated
with Savus (the river Save).&nbsp; In Britain &lsquo;the goddess&rsquo;
D&#275;va (the Dee), and Belis&#259;ma (either the Ribble or the Mersey),
a name meaning &lsquo;the most warlike <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>goddess,&rsquo;
are of this type.&nbsp; We have again Ax&#335;na the goddess of the
river Aisne, Sequ&#259;na, the goddess of the Seine, Rit&#335;na of
the river Rieu, numerous nymphs and many other deities of fountains.&nbsp;
Doubtless many other names of local deities are of this kind.&nbsp;
Aerial phenomena appear to have left very few clear traces on the names
of Celtic deities.&nbsp; Vintios, a god identified with Mars, was probably
a god of the wind, Taran&#468;cus, a god of thunder, Leucetios, a god
of lightning, Sulis (of Bath) a sun-goddess, but beyond these there
are few, if any, reflections of the phenomena of the heavens.&nbsp;
Of the gods named on inscriptions nearly all are identified with Mercury,
Mars, or Apollo.&nbsp; The gods who came to be regarded as culture-deities
appear from their names to be of various origins: some are humanised
totems, others are in origin deities of vegetation or local natural
phenomena.&nbsp; As already indicated, it is clear that the growth of
commercial and civilised life in certain districts had brought into
prominence deities identified with Mercury and Minerva as the patrons
of civilisation.&nbsp; Military men, especially in Britain, appear to
have favoured deities like Bel&#257;tucadros (the brilliant in war),
identified with Mars.</p>
<p>About fourteen inscriptions mentioning him have <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>been
found in the North of England and the South of Scotland.&nbsp; The goddess
Brigantia (the patron-deity of the Brigantes), too, is mentioned on
four inscriptions: Cocidius, identified with Mars, is mentioned on thirteen:
while another popular god appears to have been Silvanus.&nbsp; Among
the most noticeable names of the Celtic gods identified with Mercury
are Adsmerius or Atesmerius, Dumiatis (the god of the Puy de D&ocirc;me),
Iovantucarus (the lover of youth), Teutates (the god of the people),
Caletos (the hard), and Moccus (the boar).&nbsp; Several deities are
identified with Mars, and of these some of the most noticeable names
are Albiorix (world-king), Caturix (battle-king), Dunatis (the god of
the fort), Belatucadrus (the brilliant in war), Leucetius (the god of
lightning), Mullo (the mule), Ollovidius (the all-knowing) Vintius (the
wind-god), and Vitucadrus (the brilliant in energy).&nbsp; The large
number of names identified with Mars reflects the prominent place at
one time given to war in the ideas that affected the growth of the religion
of the Celtic tribes.&nbsp; Of the gods identified with Hercules, the
most interesting name is Ogmios (the god of the furrow) given by Lucian,
but not found on any inscription.&nbsp; The following gods too, among
others, are identified with Jupiter: Ar&#259;mo (the <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>gentle),
Ambisagrus (the persistent), Bussum&#257;rus (the large-lipped), Taranucus
(the thunderer), Uxell&#301;mus (the highest).&nbsp; It would seem from
this that in historic times at any rate Jupiter did not play a large
part in Celtic religious ideas.</p>
<p>There remains another striking feature of Celtic religion which has
not yet been mentioned, namely the identification of several deities
with Apollo.&nbsp; These deities are essentially the presiding deities
of certain healing-springs and health-resorts, and the growth of their
worship into popularity is a further striking index to the development
of religion side by side with certain aspects of civilisation.&nbsp;
One of the names of a Celtic Apollo is Borvo (whence Bourbon), the deity
of certain hot springs.&nbsp; This name is Indo-European, and was given
to the local fountain-god by the Celtic-speaking invaders of Gaul: it
simply means &lsquo;the Boiler.&rsquo;&nbsp; Other forms of the name
are also found, as Bormo and Borm&#257;nus.&nbsp; At Aqu&aelig; Granni
(Aix-la-Chapelle) and elsewhere the name identified with Apollo is Grannos.&nbsp;
We find also Mogons, and Mogounus, the patron deity of Moguntiacum (Mainz),
and, once or twice, Map&#335;nos (the great youth).&nbsp; The essential
feature of the Apollo worship was its association in <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>Gallo-Roman
civilisation with the idea of healing, an idea which, through the revival
of the worship of &AElig;sculapius, affected religious views very strongly
in other quarters of the empire.&nbsp; It was in this conception of
the gods as the guides of civilisation and the restorers of health,
that Celtic religion, in some districts at any rate, shows itself emerging
into a measure of light after a long and toilsome progress from the
darkness of prehistoric ideas.&nbsp; What C&aelig;sar says of the practice
of the Gauls of beginning the year with the night rather than with the
day, and their ancient belief that they were sprung from Dis, the god
of the lower world, is thus typified in their religious history.</p>
<p>In dealing with the deities of the Celtic world we must not, however,
forget the goddesses, though their history presents several problems
of great difficulty.&nbsp; Of these goddesses some are known to us by
groups&mdash;Proxim&aelig; (the kinswomen), Dervonn&aelig; (the oak-spirits),
Niskai (the water-sprites), Mair&aelig;, Matron&aelig;, Matres or Matr&aelig;
(the mothers), Quadrivi&aelig; (the goddesses of cross roads).&nbsp;
The Matres, Matr&aelig;, and Matron&aelig; are often qualified by some
local name.&nbsp; Deities of this type appear to have been popular in
Britain, in the neighbourhood of Cologne and in Provence.&nbsp; <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>In
some cases it is uncertain whether some of these grouped goddesses are
Celtic or Teutonic.&nbsp; It is an interesting parallel to the existence
of these grouped goddesses, when we find that in some parts of Wales
&lsquo;Y Mamau&rsquo; (the mothers) is the name for the fairies.&nbsp;
These grouped goddesses take us back to one of the most interesting
stages in the early Celtic religion, when the earth-spirits or the corn-spirits
had not yet been completely individualised.&nbsp; Of the individualised
goddesses many are strictly local, being the names of springs or rivers.&nbsp;
Others, again, appear to have emerged into greater individual prominence,
and of these we find several associated on inscriptions, sometimes with
a god of Celtic name, but sometimes with his Latin counterpart.&nbsp;
It is by no means certain that the names so linked together were thus
associated in early times, and the fashion may have been a later one,
which, like other fashions, spread after it had once begun.&nbsp; The
relationship in some cases may have been regarded as that of mother
and son, in others that of brother and sister, in others that of husband
and wife, the data are not adequate for the final decision of the question.&nbsp;
Of these associated pairs the following may be noted, Mercurius and
Rosmerta, Mercurius and <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>&#272;irona,
Grannus (Apollo) and Sirona, Sucellus and Nantosvelta, Borvo and Dam&#335;na,
Cicolluis (Mars) and Litavis, Bormanus and Bormana, Savus and Adsalluta,
Mars and Nemet&#335;na.&nbsp; One of these names, Sir&#335;na, probably
meant the long-lived one, and was applied to the earth-mother.&nbsp;
In Welsh one or two names have survived which, by their structure, appear
to have been ancient names of goddesses; these are Rhiannon (Rigant&#335;n&#257;,
the great queen), and Modron (Matr&#335;na, the great mother).&nbsp;
The other British deities will be more fully treated by another writer
in this series in a work on the ancient mythology of the British Isles.&nbsp;
It is enough to say that research tends more and more to confirm the
view that the key to the history of the Celtic deities is the realisation
of the local character of the vast majority of them.</p>
<h2><!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>CHAPTER
VI&mdash;THE CELTIC PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>No name in connection with Celtic religion is more familiar to the
average reader than that of the Druids, yet there is no section of the
history of Celtic religion that has given rise to greater discussion
than that relating to this order.&nbsp; Even the association of the
name with the Indo-European root <i>dru</i>-, which we find in the Greek
word <i>drus</i>, an oak, has been questioned by such a competent Celtic
scholar as M. d&rsquo;Arbois de Jubainville, but on this point it cannot
be said that his criticism is conclusive.&nbsp; The writers of the ancient
world who refer to the Druids, do not always make it sufficiently clear
in what districts the rites, ceremonies, and functions which they were
describing prevailed.&nbsp; Nor was it so much the priestly character
of the Druids that produced the deepest impression on the ancients.&nbsp;
To some philosophical and theological writers of antiquity their doctrines
and their apparent affinities with <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>Pythagoreanism
were of much greater interest than their ceremonial or other functions.&nbsp;
One thing at any rate is clear, that the Druids and their doctrines,
or supposed doctrines, had made a deep impression on the writers of
the ancient world.&nbsp; There is a reference to them in a fragment
of Aristotle (which may not, however, be genuine) that is of interest
as assigning them a place in express terms both among the Celts and
the Galat&aelig;.&nbsp; The prominent feature of their teaching which
had attracted the attention of other writers, such as the historian
Diodorus Siculus and the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria,
was the resemblance of their doctrine concerning the immortality and
transmigration of the soul to the views of Pythagoras.&nbsp; Ancient
writers, however, did not always remember that a religious or philosophical
doctrine must not be treated as a thing apart, but must be interpreted
in its whole context in relation to its development in history and in
the social life of the community in which it has flourished.&nbsp; To
some of the ancients the superficial resemblance between the Druidic
doctrine of the soul&rsquo;s future and the teaching attributed to Pythagoras
was the essential point, and this was enough to give the Druids a reputation
for philosophy, so that <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>a
writer like Clement of Alexandria goes so far as to regard the Druids
of the &lsquo;Galat&aelig;&rsquo; along with the prophets of the Egyptians,
the &lsquo;Chald&aelig;ans&rsquo; of the Assyrians, the &lsquo;philosophers
of the Celts,&rsquo; and the Magi of the Persians as the pioneers of
philosophy among the barbarians before it spread to the Greeks.&nbsp;
The reason for the distinction drawn in this passage between the &lsquo;Druids
of the Galat&aelig;&rsquo; and &lsquo;the philosophers of the Celts&rsquo;
is not clear.&nbsp; Diodorus Siculus calls attention to the Druidic
doctrine that the souls of men were immortal, and that after the lapse
of an appointed number of years they came to life again, the soul then
entering into another body.&nbsp; He says that there were certain &lsquo;philosophers
and theologians&rsquo; that were called Druids who were held in exceptional
honour.&nbsp; In addition to these, the Celts, he says, had also seers,
who foretold the future from the flight of birds and by means of the
offering of sacrifices.&nbsp; According to him it was these priestly
seers who had the masses in subjection to them.&nbsp; In great affairs
they had, he says, the practice of divination by the slaughter of a
human victim, and the observation of the attitude in which he fell,
the contortions of the limbs, the spurting of the blood, and the like.&nbsp;
This, he states, was an ancient and established <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>practice.&nbsp;
Moreover, it was the custom, according to Diodorus, to make no sacrifice
without the presence of a philosopher (apparently a Druid in addition
to the sacrificing seer), the theory being that those who were authorities
on the divine nature were to the gods intelligible mediators for the
offering of gifts and the presentation of petitions.&nbsp; These philosophers
were in great request, together with their poets, in war as well as
in peace, and were consulted not merely by the men of their own side,
but also by those of the enemy.&nbsp; Even when two armies were on the
point of joining battle, these philosophers had been able, Diodorus
says, to step into the space between them and to stop them from fighting,
exactly as if they had charmed wild beasts.&nbsp; The moral which Diodorus
draws from this is, that even among the wildest of barbarians the spirited
principle of the soul yields to wisdom, and that Ares (the god of war)
even there respects the Muses.&nbsp; It is clear from this account that
Diodorus had in mind the three classes of non-military professional
men among the Celts, to whom other ancient writers also refer, namely,
the Bards, the Seers, and the Druids.&nbsp; His narrative is apparently
an expansion, in the light of his reading and philosophical meditation,
of information supplied <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>by
previous writers, notably Posidonius.&nbsp; The latter, too, appears
to have been Julius C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s chief authority, in addition
to his own observation, but C&aelig;sar does not appear expressly to
indicate the triple division here in question.&nbsp; The account which
he gives is important, and would be even more valuable than it is had
he told us how far what he describes was written from his own personal
information, and the degree of variation (if any) of religious practice
in different districts.&nbsp; However, C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s statements
deserve the closest consideration.&nbsp; After calling attention to
the division of the Gaulish aristocracy into two main sections, the
Druids and the Knights, he proceeds to speak of the Druids.&nbsp; These
were occupied, he says, with religious matters, they attended to public
and private sacrifices, and interpreted omens.&nbsp; Moreover, they
were the teachers of the country.&nbsp; To them the young men congregated
for knowledge, and the pupils held their teachers in great respect.&nbsp;
They, too, were the judges in public and private disputes: it was they
who awarded damages and penalties.&nbsp; Any contumacy in reference
to their judgments was punished by exclusion from the sacrifices.&nbsp;
This sentence of excommunication was the severest punishment among the
Gauls.&nbsp; The men so punished were treated as outlaws, and <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>cut
off from all human society, with its rights and privileges.&nbsp; Over
these Druids there was one head, who wielded the highest influence among
them.&nbsp; On his death the nearest of the others in dignity succeeded
him, or, if several were equal, the election of a successor was made
by the vote of the Druids.&nbsp; Sometimes the primacy was not decided
without the arbitrament of arms.&nbsp; The Druids met at a fixed time
of the year in a consecrated spot in the territory of the Carnutes,
the district which was regarded as being in the centre of the whole
of Gaul.&nbsp; This assembly of Druids formed a court for the decision
of cases brought to them from everywhere around.&nbsp; It was thought,
C&aelig;sar says, that the doctrine of the Druids was discovered in
Britain and thence carried over into Gaul.&nbsp; At that time, too,
those who wanted to make a profounder study of it resorted thither for
their training.&nbsp; The Druids had immunity from military service
and from the payment of tribute.&nbsp; These privileges drew many into
training for the profession, some of their own accord, others at the
instance of parents and relatives.&nbsp; While in training they were
said to learn by heart a large number of verses, and some went so far
as to spend twenty years in their course of preparation.&nbsp; The Druids
held it wrong to put their <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>religious
teaching in writing, though, in almost everything else, whether public
or private affairs, they made use of Greek letters.&nbsp; C&aelig;sar
thought that they discouraged writing on the one hand, lest their teaching
should become public property; on the other, lest reliance upon writing
should lessen the cultivation of the memory.&nbsp; To this risk C&aelig;sar
could testify from his own knowledge.&nbsp; Their cardinal doctrine
was that souls did not perish, but that after death they passed from
one person to another; and this they regarded as a supreme incentive
to valour, since, with the prospect of immortality, the fear of death
counted for nothing.&nbsp; They carried on, moreover, many discussions
about the stars and their motion, the greatness of the universe and
the lands, the nature of things, the strength and power of the immortal
gods, and communicated their knowledge to their pupils.&nbsp; In another
passage C&aelig;sar says that the Gauls as a people were extremely devoted
to religious ideas and practices.&nbsp; Men who were seriously ill,
who were engaged in war, or who stood in any peril, offered, or promised
to offer, human sacrifices, and made use of the Druids as their agents
for such sacrifices.&nbsp; Their theory was, that the immortal gods
could not be appeased unless a human life were given for a <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>human
life.&nbsp; In addition to these private sacrifices, they had also similar
human sacrifices of a public character.&nbsp; C&aelig;sar further contrasts
the Germans with the Gauls, saying that the former had no Druids to
preside over matters of religion, and that they paid no attention to
sacrifices.</p>
<p>In his work on divination, Cicero, too, refers to the profession
which the Druids made of natural science, and of the power of foretelling
the future, and instances the case of the &AElig;duan Div&#301;ci&#257;cus,
his brother&rsquo;s guest and friend.&nbsp; Nothing is here said by
Cicero of the three classes implied in Diodorus, but Timagenes (quoted
in Ammianus) refers to the three classes under the names &lsquo;bardi,&rsquo;
&lsquo;euhages&rsquo; (a mistake for &lsquo;vates&rsquo;), and &lsquo;drasid&aelig;&rsquo;
(a mistake for &lsquo;druid&aelig;&rsquo;).&nbsp; The study of nature
and of the heavens is here attributed to the second class of seers (vates).&nbsp;
The highest class, that of the Druids, were, he says, in accordance
with the rule of Pythagoras, closely linked together in confraternities,
and by acquiring a certain loftiness of mind from their investigations
into things that were hidden and exalted, they despised human affairs
and declared the soul immortal.&nbsp; We see here the view expressed
that socially as well as intellectually the Druids lived according to
the Pythagorean philosophy.&nbsp; Origen <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>also
refers to the view that was prevalent in his time, that Zamolxis, the
servant of Pythagoras, had taught the Druids the philosophy of Pythagoras.&nbsp;
He further states that the Druids practised sorcery.&nbsp; The triple
division of the non-military aristocracy is perhaps best given by Strabo,
the Greek geographer, who here follows Posidonius.&nbsp; The three classes
are the Bards, the Seers (ouateis=vates), and Druids.&nbsp; The Bards
were hymn-writers and poets, the Seers sacrificers and men of science,
while the Druids, in addition to natural science, practised also moral
philosophy.&nbsp; They were regarded as the justest of men, and on this
account were intrusted with the settlement of private and public disputes.&nbsp;
They had been the means of preventing armies from fighting when on the
very verge of battle, and were especially intrusted with the judgment
of cases involving human life.&nbsp; According to Strabo, they and their
fellow-countrymen held that souls and the universe were immortal, but
that fire and water would sometime prevail.&nbsp; Sacrifices were never
made, Strabo says, without the intervention of the Druids.&nbsp; Pomponius
Mela says that in his time (c. 44 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>),
though the ancient savagery was no more, and the Gauls abstained from
human sacrifices, some traces of their former practices <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>still
remained, notably in their habit of cutting a portion of the flesh of
those condemned to death after bringing them to the altars.&nbsp; The
Gauls, he says, in spite of their traces of barbarism, had an eloquence
of their own, and had the Druids as their teachers in philosophy.&nbsp;
These professed to know the size and form of the earth and of the universe,
the motions of the sky and stars, and the will of the gods.&nbsp; He
refers, as C&aelig;sar does, to their work in education, and says that
it was carried on in caves or in secluded groves.&nbsp; Mela speaks
of their doctrine of immortality, but says nothing as to the entry of
souls into other bodies.&nbsp; As a proof of this belief he speaks of
the practice of burning and burying with the dead things appropriate
to the needs of the living.&nbsp; Lucan, the Latin poet, in his <i>Pharsalia</i>,
refers to the seclusion of the Druids&rsquo; groves and to their doctrine
of immortality.&nbsp; The Scholiasts&rsquo; notes on this passage are
after the manner of their kind, and add very little to our knowledge.&nbsp;
In Pliny&rsquo;s <i>Natural History</i> (xvi, 249), however, we seem
to be face to face with another, though perhaps a distorted, tradition.&nbsp;
Pliny was an indefatigable compiler, and appears partly by reading,
partly by personal observation, to have noticed phases of Celtic <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>religious
practices which other writers had overlooked.&nbsp; In the first place
he calls attention to the veneration in which the Gauls held the mistletoe
and the tree on which it grew, provided that that tree was the oak.&nbsp;
Hence their predilection for oak groves and their requirement of oak
leaves for all religious rites.&nbsp; Pliny here remarks on the consonance
of this practice with the etymology of the name Druid as interpreted
even through Greek (the Greek for an oak being <i>dr&#363;s</i>).&nbsp;
Were not this respect for the oak and for the mistletoe paralleled by
numerous examples of tree and plant-worship given by Dr. Frazer and
others, it might well have been suspected that Pliny was here quoting
some writer who had tried to argue from the etymology of the name Druid.&nbsp;
Another suspicious circumstance in Pliny&rsquo;s account is his reference
to the serpent&rsquo;s egg composed of snakes rolled together into a
ball.&nbsp; He states that he himself had seen such an &lsquo;egg,&rsquo;
of about the size of an apple.&nbsp; Pliny, too, states that Tiberius
C&aelig;sar abolished by a decree of the Senate the Druids and the kind
of seers and physicians the Gauls then had.&nbsp; This statement, when
read in its context, probably refers to the prohibition of human sacrifices.&nbsp;
The historian Suetonius, in his account <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>of
the Emperor Claudius, also states that Augustus had prohibited &lsquo;the
religion of the Druids&rsquo; (which, he says, &lsquo;was one of fearful
savagery&rsquo;) to Roman citizens, but that Claudius had entirely abolished
it.&nbsp; What is here also meant, in view of the description given
of Druidism, is doubtless the abolishing of its human sacrifices.&nbsp;
In later Latin writers there are several references to Druidesses, but
these were probably only sorceresses.&nbsp; In Irish the name <i>dr&uacute;i</i>
(genitive <i>druad</i>) meant a magician, and the word <i>derwydd</i>
in medi&aelig;val Welsh was especially used in reference to the vaticinations
which were then popular in Wales.</p>
<p>When we analyse the testimony of ancient writers concerning the Druids,
we see in the first place that to different minds the name connoted
different things.&nbsp; To C&aelig;sar it is the general name for the
non-military professional class, whether priests, seers, teachers, lawyers,
or judges.&nbsp; To others the Druids are pre-eminently the philosophers
and teachers of the Gauls, and are distinguished from the seers designated
<i>vates</i>.&nbsp; To others again, such as Pliny, they were the priests
of the oak-ritual, whence their name was derived.&nbsp; In view of the
variety of grades of civilisation then co-existing in Gaul and Britain,
it is not <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>improbable
that the development of the non-military professional class varied very
considerably in different districts, and that all the aspects of Druidism
which the ancient writers specify found their appropriate places in
the social system of the Celts.&nbsp; In Gaul and Britain, as elsewhere,
the office of the primitive tribal medicine-man was capable of indefinite
development, and all the forms of its evolution could not have proceeded
<i>pari passu</i> where the sociological conditions found such scope
for variation.&nbsp; It may well be that the oak and mistletoe ceremonies,
for example, lingered in remote agricultural districts long after they
had ceased to interest men along the main routes of Celtic civilisation.&nbsp;
The bucolic mind does not readily abandon the practices of millennia.</p>
<p>In addition to the term Druid, we find in Aulus Hirtius&rsquo; continuation
of C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s <i>Gallic War</i> (Bk. viii., c. xxxviii., 2),
as well as on two inscriptions, one at Le-Puy-en-Velay (Dep. Haute-Loire),
and the other at M&acirc;con (Dep. Sa&ocirc;ne-et-Loire), another priestly
title, &lsquo;gutuater.&rsquo;&nbsp; At M&acirc;con the office is that
of a &lsquo;gutuater Martis,&rsquo; but of its special features nothing
is known.</p>
<h2><!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>CHAPTER
VII&mdash;THE CELTIC OTHER-WORLD</h2>
<p>In the preceding chapter we have seen that the belief was widely
prevalent among Greek and Roman writers that the Druids taught the immortality
of the soul.&nbsp; Some of these writers, too, point out the undoubted
fact, attested by Arch&aelig;ology, that objects which would be serviceable
to the living were buried with the dead, and this was regarded as a
confirmation of the view that the immortality of souls was to the Celts
an object of belief.&nbsp; The study of Arch&aelig;ology on the one
hand, and of Comparative Religion on the other, certainly leads to the
conclusion that in the Bronze and the Early Iron Age, and in all probability
in the Stone Age, the idea prevailed that death was not the end of man.&nbsp;
The holed cromlechs of the later Stone Age were probably designed for
the egress and ingress of souls.&nbsp; The food and the weapons that
were buried with the dead were thought to be objects of genuine <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>need.&nbsp;
Roman religion, too, in some of its rites provided means for the periodical
expulsion of hungry and hostile spirits of the dead, and for their pacification
by the offer of food.&nbsp; A tomb and its adjuncts were meant not merely
for the honour of the dead, but also for the protection of the living.&nbsp;
A clear line of distinction was drawn between satisfied and beneficent
ghosts like the Manes, and the unsatisfied and hostile ghosts like the
Lemures and Larv&aelig;.&nbsp; To the Celtic mind, when its analytical
powers had come to birth, and man was sufficiently self-conscious to
reflect upon himself, the problem of his own nature pressed for some
solution.&nbsp; In these solutions the breath, the blood, the name,
the head, and even the hair generally played a part, but these would
not in themselves explain the mysterious phenomena of sleep, of dreams,
of epilepsy, of madness, of disease, of man&rsquo;s shadow and his reflection,
and of man&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; By long familiarity with the scientific
or quasi-scientific explanations of these things, we find it difficult
to realise fully their constant fascination for early man, who had his
thinkers and philosophies like ourselves.&nbsp; One very widely accepted
solution of early man in the Celtic world was, that within him there
was another self which could live a <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>life
of its own apart from the body, and which survived even death, burial,
and burning.&nbsp; Sometimes this inner self was associated with the
breath, whence, for example, the Latin &lsquo;anima&rsquo; and the Welsh
&lsquo;enaid,&rsquo; both meaning the soul, from the root <i>an</i>-,
to breathe.&nbsp; At other times the term employed for the second self
had reference to man&rsquo;s shadow: the Greek &lsquo;skia,&rsquo; the
Latin &lsquo;umbra,&rsquo; the Welsh &lsquo;ysgawd,&rsquo; the English
&lsquo;shade.&rsquo;&nbsp; There are abundant evidences, too, that the
life-principle was frequently regarded as being especially associated
with the blood.&nbsp; Another tendency, of which Principal Rh&#375;s
has given numerous examples in his Welsh folk-lore, was to regard the
soul as capable of taking a visible form, not necessarily human, preferably
that of some winged creature.&nbsp; In ancient writers there is no information
as to the views prevalent among the Celts regarding the forms or the
abodes of the spirits of the dead, beyond the statement that the Druids
taught the doctrine of their re-birth.&nbsp; We are thus compelled to
look to the evidence afforded by myth, legend, and folk-lore.&nbsp;
These give fair indications as to the types of earlier popular belief
in these matters, but it would be a mistake to assume that the ideas
embodied in them had remained entirely unchanged from remote times.&nbsp;
<!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>The
mind of man at certain levels is quite capable of evolving new myths
and fresh folk-lore along the lines of its own psychology and its own
logic.&nbsp; The forms which the soul could take doubtless varied greatly
in men&rsquo;s opinions in different districts and in different mental
perspectives, but folk-lore tends to confirm the view that early man,
in the Celtic world as elsewhere, tended to emphasise his conception
of the subtlety and mobility of the soul as contrasted with the body.&nbsp;
Sooner or later the primitive philosopher was bound to consider whither
the soul went in dreams or in death.&nbsp; He may not at first have
thought of any other sphere than that of his own normal life, but other
questions, such as the home of the spirits of vegetation in or under
the earth, would suggest, even if this thought had not occurred to him
before, that the spirits of men, too, had entrance to the world below.&nbsp;
Whether this world was further pictured in imagination depended largely
on the poetic genius of any given people.&nbsp; The folk-lore of the
Celtic races bears abundant testimony to their belief that beneath this
world there was another.&nbsp; The &lsquo;annwfn&rsquo; of the Welsh
was distinctly conceived in the folk-lore embodied in medi&aelig;val
poetry as being &lsquo;is elfydd&rsquo; (beneath the world).&nbsp; In
medi&aelig;val Welsh legend, again, <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>this
lower world is regarded as divided into kingdoms, like this world, and
its kings, like Arawn and Hafgan in the Mabinogi of Pwyll, are represented
as being sometimes engaged in conflict.&nbsp; From this lower world
had come to man some of the blessings of civilisation, and among them
the much prized gift of swine.&nbsp; The lower world could be even plundered
by enterprising heroes.&nbsp; Marriages like that of Pwyll and Rhiannon
were possible between the dwellers of the one world and the other.&nbsp;
The other-world of the Celts does not seem, however, to have been always
pictured as beneath the earth.&nbsp; Irish and Welsh legend combine
in viewing it at times as situated on distant islands, and Welsh folk-lore
contains several suggestions of another world situated beneath the waters
of a lake, a river, or a sea.&nbsp; In one or two passages also of Welsh
medi&aelig;val poetry the shades are represented as wandering in the
woods of Caledonia (Coed Celyddon).&nbsp; This was no doubt a traditional
idea in those families that migrated to Wales in post-Roman times from
Strathclyde.&nbsp; To those who puzzled over the fate of the souls of
the dead the idea of their re-birth was a very natural solution, and
Mr. Alfred Nutt, in his <i>Voyage of Bran</i>, has called attention
to the occurrence of this idea in Irish legend.&nbsp; It <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>does
not follow, however, that the souls of all men would enjoy the privilege
of this re-birth.&nbsp; As Mr. Alfred Nutt points out, Irish legend
seems to regard this re-birth only as the privilege of the truly great.&nbsp;
It is of interest to note the curious persistence of similar ideas as
to death and the other-world in literature written even in Christian
times and by monastic scribes.&nbsp; In Welsh, in addition to Annwfn,
a term which seems to mean the &lsquo;Not-world,&rsquo; we have other
names for the world below, such as &lsquo;anghar,&rsquo; the loveless
place; &lsquo;difant,&rsquo; the unrimmed place (whence the modern Welsh
word &lsquo;difancoll,&rsquo; lost for ever); &lsquo;affwys,&rsquo;
the abyss; &lsquo;affan,&rsquo; the land invisible.&nbsp; The upper-world
is sometimes called &lsquo;elfydd,&rsquo; sometimes &lsquo;adfant,&rsquo;
the latter term meaning the place whose rim is turned back.&nbsp; Apparently
it implies a picture of the earth as a disc, whose rim or lip is curved
back so as to prevent men from falling over into the &lsquo;difant,&rsquo;
or the rimless place.&nbsp; In modern Celtic folk-lore the various local
other-worlds are the abodes of fairies, and in these traditions there
may possibly be, as Principal Rh&#375;s has suggested, some intermixture
of reminiscences of the earlier inhabitants of the various districts.&nbsp;
Modern folk-lore, like medi&aelig;val legend, has its stories of the
inter-marriages <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>of
natives of this world with those of the other-world, often located underneath
a lake.&nbsp; The curious reader will find several examples of such
stories in Principal Rh&#375;s&rsquo;s collection of Welsh and Manx
folk-lore.&nbsp; In Irish legend one of the most classical of these
stories is that of the betrothal of Etain, a story which has several
points of contact with the narrative of the meeting of Pwyll and Rhiannon
in the Welsh Mabinogi.&nbsp; The name of Arthur&rsquo;s wife, Gwenhwyfar,
which means &lsquo;the White Spectre,&rsquo; also suggests that originally
she too played a part in a story of the same kind.&nbsp; In all these
and similar narratives, it is important to note the way in which the
Celtic conceptions of the other-world, in Britain and in Ireland, have
been coloured by the geographical aspects of these two countries, by
their seas, their islands, their caves, their mounds, their lakes, and
their mountains.&nbsp; The local other-worlds of these lands bear, as
we might have expected, the clear impress of their origin.&nbsp; On
the whole the conceptions of the other-world which we meet in Celtic
legend are joyous; it is a land of youth and beauty.&nbsp; Cuchulainn,
the Irish hero, for example, is brought in a boat to an exceedingly
fair island round which there is a silver wall and a bronze palisade.&nbsp;
<!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>In
one Welsh legend the cauldron of the Head of Annwfn has around it a
rim of pearls.&nbsp; One Irish story has a na&iuml;ve description of
the glories of the Celtic Elysium in the words&mdash;&lsquo;Admirable
was that land: there are three trees there always bearing fruit, one
pig always alive, and another ready cooked.&rsquo;&nbsp; Occasionally,
however, we find a different picture.&nbsp; In the Welsh poem called
&lsquo;Y Gododin&rsquo; the poet Aneirin is represented as expressing
his gratitude at being rescued by the son of Llywarch Hen from &lsquo;the
cruel prison of the earth, from the abode of death, from the loveless
land.&rsquo;&nbsp; The salient features, therefore, of the Celtic conceptions
of the other-world are their consonance with the suggestions made by
Celtic scenery to the Celtic imagination, the vagueness and variability
of these conceptions in different minds and in different moods, the
absence of any ethical considerations beyond the incentive given to
bravery by the thought of immortality, and the remarkable development
of a sense of possible inter-relations between the two worlds, whether
pacific or hostile.&nbsp; Such conceptions, as we see from Celtic legend,
proved an admirable stimulus and provided excellent material for the
development of Celtic narrative, and the weird and romantic effect was
further <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>heightened
by the general belief in the possibilities of magic and metamorphosis.&nbsp;
Moreover, the association with innumerable place-names of legends of
this type gave the beautiful scenery of Celtic lands an added charm,
which has attached their inhabitants to them with a subtle and unconquerable
attachment scarcely intelligible to the more prosaic inhabitants of
prosaic lands.&nbsp; To the poetic Celt the love of country tends to
become almost a religion.&nbsp; The Celtic mind cannot remain indifferent
to lands and seas whose very beauty compels the eyes of man to gaze
upon them to their very horizon, and the lines of observation thus drawn
to the horizon are for the Celt continual temptations to the thought
of an infinity beyond.&nbsp; The preoccupation of the Celtic mind with
the deities of his scenery, his springs, his rivers, his seas, his forests,
his mountains, his lakes, was in thorough keeping with the tenour of
his mind, when tuned to its natural surroundings.&nbsp; In dealing with
Celtic religion, mythology, and legend, it is not so much the varying
local and temporal forms that demand our attention, as the all-pervading
and animating spirit, which shows its essential character even through
the scanty remains of the ancient Celtic world.&nbsp; Celtic religion
bears the impress of <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>nature
on earth far more than nature in the heavens.&nbsp; The sense of the
heaven above has perhaps survived in some of the general Indo-European
Celtic terms for the divine principle, and there are some traces of
a religious interest in the sun and the god of thunder and lightning,
but every student of Celtic religion must feel that the main and characteristic
elements are associated with the earth in all the variety of its local
phenomena.&nbsp; The great earth-mother and her varied offspring ever
come to view in Celtic religion under many names, and the features even
of the other-world could not be dissociated for the Celt from those
of his mother-earth.&nbsp; The festivals of his year, too, were associated
with the decay and the renewal of her annual life.&nbsp; The bonfires
of November, May, Midsummer, and August were doubtless meant to be associated
with the vicissitudes of her life and the spirits that were her children.&nbsp;
For the Celt the year began in November, so that its second half-year
commenced with the first of May.&nbsp; The idea to which C&aelig;sar
refers, that the Gauls believed themselves descended from Dis, the god
of the lower world, and began the year with the night, counting their
time not by days but by nights, points in the same <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>direction,
namely that the darkness of the earth had a greater hold on the mind
than the brightness of the sky.&nbsp; The Welsh terms for a week and
a fortnight, <i>wythnos</i> (eight nights) and <i>pythefnos</i> (fifteen
nights) respectively confirm C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s statement.&nbsp; To
us now it may seem more natural to associate religion with the contemplation
of the heavens, but for the Celtic lands at any rate the main trend
of the evidence is to show that the religious mind was mainly drawn
to a contemplation of the earth and her varied life, and that the Celt
looked for his other-world either beneath the earth, with her rivers,
lakes, and seas, or in the islands on the distant horizon, where earth
and sky met.&nbsp; This predominance of the earth in religion was in
thorough keeping with the intensity of religion as a factor in his daily
pursuits.&nbsp; It was this intensity that gave the Druids at some time
or other in the history of the Western Celts the power which C&aelig;sar
and others assign to them.&nbsp; The whole people of the Gauls, even
with their military aristocracy, were extremely devoted to religious
ideas, though these led to the inhumanity of human sacrifices.&nbsp;
At one time their sense of the reality of the other-world was so great,
that they believed that loans contracted in this world would be repaid
there, <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>and
practical belief could not go much further than that.&nbsp; All these
considerations tend to show how important it is, in the comparative
study of religions, to investigate each religion in its whole sociological
and geographical environment as well as in the etymological meaning
of its terms.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the writer hopes that this brief sketch, which is
based on an independent study of the main evidence for the religious
ideas and practices of the Celtic peoples, will help to interest students
of religion in the dominant modes of thought which from time immemorial
held sway in these lands of the West of Europe, and which in folk-lore
and custom occasionally show themselves even in the midst of our highly
developed and complex civilisation of to-day.&nbsp; The thought of early
man on the problems of his being&mdash;for after all his superstitions
reveal thought&mdash;deserve respect, for in his efforts to think he
was trying to grope towards the light.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
